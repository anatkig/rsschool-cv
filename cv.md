##  PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
_______________________________________
<p>I have worked for over 12 years as an English teacher in various places. During those years I managed to receive several professional certificates, learn Spanish language, study computer languages such as Java, Python, C++ and JavaScript.</p> 
<p>In fact, I have always been fascinated with IT. For that reason I have decided to try myself in this area professionally.</p> <p>I believe my experience with both human and computer languages might be a valuable asset here.</p> 
<p> Naturally, because of all my achievements so far I consider myself a good learner.</p>

## IT Skills

<p>I have tried myself in Java creating simple projects in NetBeans.</p>
